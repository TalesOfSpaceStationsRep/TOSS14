                                       TOP THREE REASONS WHY THE SYNDICATE IS INCOMPETENT

                                       NUMBER ONE
                                       THEIR SLEEPER AGENTS ARE INCOMPETENT! THEY CAN'T EVEN KILL A PASSENGER WITH A DEATHWISH!

                                       NUMBER TWO
                                       THEIR CIVILIANS ARE WEAK TO BULLETS! TRUST ME, WE TRIED! UNLIKE THE NANOTRASEN CIVILIANS, SYNDICATE CIVILIANS DIE FROM A BULLET TO THE SKULL! BULLETS WE HAVE!

                                       NUMBER THREE
                                       THEIR LOGO IS HORRIBLE! THEY THINK THEY'RE COOL WITH THEIR LOGO! OOH, LOOK AT ME, I'M SO COOL! OOH, SNAKE THAT'S ALSO AN S! HOW CREATIVE! MY THREE YEAR OLD SON COULD DRAW A BETTER LOGO!

                                            NUMBER TWO
                                            THEIR COMMANDERS? THEY DIE FROM A SINGLE SHOT! NO COOL ARMOR! JUST BANG, DEAD! LAME! OUR COMMANDERS GET COOL HARDSUITS!

                                            NUMBER THREE
                                            THEIR MURDER METHODS ARE UNINSPIRED! IT'S JUST GUN! THERE'S NO THROWING PEOPLE INTO DEEP SPACE, NO FEEDING PEOPLE INTO RECYCLERS WITH SAFETY MODE DISENGAGED, NO SLIPPING BOMBS INTO POCKETS! SO BORING!
